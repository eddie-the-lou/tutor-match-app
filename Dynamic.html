    "bio": "Pascale Fung is a Sophomore in Mather House planning to concentrate in Neurobiology. She is originally from San Diego, CA but now resides in Irvine, CA. Pascale loves to run, crochet, and cook in her free time. Her passions include uncovering the mystery of the human brain, educational outreach, and mentoring younger students. Pascale specializes in SAT/ACT prep and college counseling, though she also tutors in subjects such as human anatomy, math, and English. In high school, she focused on and received a 36 on the ACT, and also took the SAT once and received a 1570 before switching to the ACT. Her awards include the AP Scholar Award with Distinction and the Notre Dame Neuroscience Pre-College Program Scholarship, recognition as the Questbridge National College Match Finalist, and the ELC reward from the University of California as part of the top 9% of the state’s high school students. \n\nAt Harvard, she is currently VP of the HUMBB: Brain, part of the Socials board for Harvard Undergrad Mission: Brain, and writes for the Harvard Brain Journal. Over the summer, she conducted research with a UCI Neuroscience professor on the effects of adolescent stress on the post-parietal cortex’s ability to make long-term memories and shadowed UCI Health neurosurgeons in the local hospital. For fun, she dances with the Asian American Dance Troupe at Harvard, volunteers at the local Boston hospitals MGH and Brigham and Women’s, is a volunteer English teacher with the Phillips Brooks House Association, and, of course, tutors with HSA!\n",
